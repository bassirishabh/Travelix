## FAQ about Travelix

### Q1 What is exactly the function of your tool? That is, what will it do?

Travelix is a personalized travel recommendation system that provides recommendations to users based on their preferences, budget, and travel history. The tool will analyze user preferences and destination data (granular to City level) to recommend destinations and hotels that match the user's preferences along with complete possible itinerary such as flights, restaurants, events and attractions.

### Q2 Why would we need such a tool and who would you expect to use it and

benefit from it?
Travelix would be useful for people who are looking for personalized travel recommendations that match their interests and budget. It could be used by travel enthusiasts, families, couples, and anyone else who wants to plan a trip. Recommendation systems in the field of travel and tourism domain are very less compared to other domains. By using Travelix, users can save time and effort in researching and planning their travel itinerary.

### Q3 Does this kind of tool already exist? If similar tools exist, how is your tool

different from them? Would people care about the difference? How hard is it
to build such a tool? What is the challenge?
Some tools such as TripAdvisor and Expedia exist which help plan travel itineraries but do not offer any level of personalization for users. It can be challenging to build such a tool because it requires a large amount of data and a complex algorithm. Due to the sparsity of the data available which includes reviews and ratings from travelers it is difficult to build personalized recommendations for the above use case.
