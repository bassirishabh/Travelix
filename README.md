## FAQ about Travelix

### Q1 What is exactly the function of your tool? That is, what will it do?

Travelix is a personalized travel recommendation system that provides recommendations to users based on their preferences, budget, and travel history. The tool will analyze user preferences and destination data (granular to City level) to recommend destinations and hotels that match the user's preferences along with complete possible itinerary such as flights, restaurants, events and attractions.

### Q2 Why would we need such a tool and who would you expect to use it and benefit from it?

Travelix would be useful for people who are looking for personalized travel recommendations that match their interests and budget. It could be used by travel enthusiasts, families, couples, and anyone else who wants to plan a trip. Recommendation systems in the field of travel and tourism domain are very less compared to other domains. By using Travelix, users can save time and effort in researching and planning their travel itinerary.

### Q3 Does this kind of tool already exist? If similar tools exist, how is your tool different from them? Would people care about the difference? How hard is it to build such a tool? What is the challenge?

Some tools such as TripAdvisor and Expedia exist which help plan travel itineraries but do not offer any level of personalization for users. It can be challenging to build such a tool because it requires a large amount of data and a complex algorithm. Due to the sparsity of the data available which includes reviews and ratings from travelers it is difficult to build personalized recommendations for the above use case.

## App running Instructions

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
